Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and
changing any kind of text very efficient. Vim is rock stable and is
continuously being developed to become even better. Among its features
are:

    * persistent, multi-level undo tree
    * extensive plugin system
    * support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
    * powerful search and replace
    * integrates with many tools

Please note that this is not a straight port of the upstream version.
It includes a full MUI GUI with most of the bells and whistles found
in Vim on any of the major platforms.
